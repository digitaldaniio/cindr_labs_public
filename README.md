## 🕵️ Currently in Stealth Mode

Cindr Labs is an independent R&D studio developing interoperable systems for fabrication, manufacturing, and construction workflows.

We’re finalizing intellectual property protections and operating in limited pilot environments.  
Public documentation and technical details will be released following formal filings.

## 🏭 Proven in Production

Our systems are already being used by select partners in Los Angeles, helping streamline fabrication and service operations through secure, automated infrastructure.

*(All implementations remain confidential while under IP review.)*

## 🧠 What Drives Us

> “Build like a craftsman. Automate like an engineer.”

Cindr Labs exists to make complex, disconnected workflows **usable, auditable, and resilient** — turning legacy processes into modern, verifiable systems.

We believe infrastructure should be:
- **Deterministic** — repeatable and provable  
- **Compliant** — privacy- and regulation-aware  
- **Sustainable** — simple enough to maintain, strong enough to scale
