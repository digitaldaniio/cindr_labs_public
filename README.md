## 🕵️ Currently in Stealth Mode

Cindr Labs is an independent R&D studio developing real systems for fabrication, manufacturing, and construction workflows.

We’re finalizing our IP protections and operating in limited pilot environments.  

---

## 🏭 Proven in Production

Our systems are already being used by select partners in Los Angeles, helping streamline fabrication and service operations through secure, automated infrastructure.

*(All implementations remain confidential while under IP review.)*

## 🧠 What Drives Us

> “Build like a craftsman. Automate like an engineer.”

Cindr Labs exists to make complex, disconnected workflows **usable, auditable, and resilient** turning legacy processes into modern, verifiable systems.

We believe infrastructure should be:
- **Deterministic** — repeatable and provable  
- **Compliant** — privacy and regulation aware  
- **Sustainable** — simple enough to maintain, strong enough to scale
